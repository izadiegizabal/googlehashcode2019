Our Google Hash Code 2019 Challenge Solution! With it, we were able to end in the top 13.3% ([885th/6640](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive/2019)), not bad for our first coding competition!

Regarding the developed algorithm, we first join the vertical photos in slides based on the least amount of tags in common they have, in order to have more matching posibilities with the horizontal slides.

We then go over all the horizontal photos and calculate the minimum interest factor, following the optimisation [problem statement](https://github.com/izadiegizabal/googlehashcode2019/blob/master/photo_slideshow.pdf), until we find the one with whom it will have the biggest interest factor. Once we do that, we add them to the final ordered slides list and then repeat the process until we get the final ordered slides.

As you can imagine, this is not the most efficient way of solving the problem, but this simple method proved to be quite reliable!

Thanks to this we were able to finish first of our Hub, 24th in Spain and 885th Worldwide, top 6.2% in Spain and 13.3% globally, where more than 6640 teams competed! Taking into account it was our first code challenge, we are really happy with the results! We had a really good time and we hope to repeat the experience!

With this code we were able to achieve over 700K Points in the Online Qualification Round.

And over 1M Points in the Extended Round thanks to extra time time to run the program and compile de answers.

For the Extended Round the results improved and we ended up 7th in Spain (top 1.8%) and 115th globally (top **1.7%**)!
